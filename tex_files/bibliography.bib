              Quantum computers are expected to be better at solving certain computational problems than classical computers. This expectation is based on (well-founded) conjectures in computational complexity theory, but rigorous comparisons between the capabilities of quantum and classical algorithms are difficult to perform. Bravyi 
              et al. 
              proved theoretically that whereas the number of “steps” needed by parallel quantum circuits to solve certain linear algebra problems was independent of the problem size, this number grew logarithmically with size for analogous classical circuits (see the Perspective by Montanaro). This so-called quantum advantage stems from the quantum correlations present in quantum circuits that cannot be reproduced in analogous classical circuits.

            Parallel quantum circuits outperform classical counterparts at solving certain linear algebra problems. 
          ,  
            Quantum effects can enhance information-processing capabilities and speed up the solution of certain computational problems. Whether a quantum advantage can be rigorously proven in some setting or demonstrated experimentally using near-term devices is the subject of active debate. We show that parallel quantum algorithms running in a constant time period are strictly more powerful than their classical counterparts; they are provably better at solving certain linear algebra problems associated with binary quadratic forms. Our work gives an unconditional proof of a computational quantum advantage and simultaneously pinpoints its origin: It is a consequence of quantum nonlocality. The proposed quantum algorithm is a suitable candidate for near-future experimental realizations, as it requires only constant-depth quantum circuits with nearest-neighbor gates on a two-dimensional grid of qubits (quantum bits).},

The open-source toolkit offers a detailed hierarchy of modules and classes implementing all stages of a pipeline for converting sentences to string diagrams, tensor networks, and quantum circuits ready to be used on a quantum computer. lambeq supports syntactic parsing, rewriting and simplification of string diagrams, ansatz creation and manipulation, as well as a number of compositional models for preparing quantum-friendly representations of sentences, employing various degrees of syntax sensitivity. We present the generic architecture and describe the most important modules in detail, demonstrating the usage with illustrative examples. Further, we test the toolkit in practice by using it to perform a number of experiments on simple NLP tasks, implementing both classical and quantum pipelines.},

While VQAs may enable practical applications of noisy quantum computers, they are nevertheless heuristic methods with unproven scaling. Here, we rigorously prove two results, assuming V(θ) is an alternating layered ansatz composed of blocks forming local 2-designs. Our first result states that defining C in terms of global observables leads to exponentially vanishing gradients (i.e., barren plateaus) even when V(θ) is shallow. Hence, several VQAs in the literature must revise their proposed costs. On the other hand, our second result states that defining C with local observables leads to at worst a polynomially vanishing gradient, so long as the depth of V(θ) is \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}{\textbackslash},n)\$\$. Our results establish a connection between locality and trainability. We illustrate these ideas with large-scale simulations, up to 100 qubits, of a quantum autoencoder implementation.},

A natural question is whether noise on NISQ devices places fundamental limitations on VQA performance. We rigorously prove a serious limitation for noisy VQAs, in that the noise causes the training landscape to have a barren plateau (i.e., vanishing gradient). Specifically, for the local Pauli noise considered, we prove that the gradient vanishes exponentially in the number of qubits n if the depth of the ansatz grows linearly with n. These noise-induced barren plateaus (NIBPs) are conceptually different from noise-free barren plateaus, which are linked to random parameter initialization. Our result is formulated for a generic ansatz that includes as special cases the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz and the Unitary Coupled Cluster Ansatz, among others. For the former, our numerical heuristics demonstrate the NIBP phenomenon for a realistic hardware noise model.},

	abstract = {Parametrized quantum circuits serve as ansatze for solving variational problems and provide a flexible paradigm for the programming of near-term quantum computers. Ideally, such ansatze should be highly expressive, so that a close approximation of the desired solution can be accessed. On the other hand, the ansatz must also have sufficiently large gradients to allow for training. Here, we derive a fundamental relationship between these two essential properties: expressibility and trainability. This is done by extending the well-established barren plateau phenomenon, which holds for ansatze that form exact 2-designs, to arbitrary ansatze. Specifically, we calculate the variance in the cost gradient in terms of the expressibility of the ansatz, as measured by its distance from being a 2-design. Our resulting bounds indicate that highly expressive ansatze exhibit flatter cost landscapes and therefore will be harder to train. Furthermore, we provide numerics illustrating the effect of expressibility on gradient scalings and we discuss the implications for designing strategies to avoid barren plateaus.},

Such hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are popular for applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning. Due to its simplicity and hardware efficiency, random circuits are often proposed as initial guesses for exploring the space of quantum states. We show that the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity make this choice unsuitable for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms run on more than a few qubits. Specifically, we show that for a wide class of reasonable parameterized quantum circuits, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits. We argue that this is related to the 2-design characteristic of random circuits, and that solutions to this problem must be studied.},

CheckList includes a matrix of general linguistic capabilities and test types that facilitate comprehensive test ideation, as well as a software tool to generate a large and diverse number of test cases quickly. We illustrate the utility of CheckList with tests for three tasks, identifying critical failures in both commercial and state-of-art models. In a user study, a team responsible for a commercial sentiment analysis model found new and actionable bugs in an extensively tested model. In another user study, NLP practitioners with CheckList created twice as many tests, and found almost three times as many bugs as users without it.},

Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female. Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias.},

Although NLP models have shown success in modeling various applications, they propagate and may even amplify gender bias found in text corpora. While the study of bias in artificial intelligence is not new, methods to mitigate gender bias in NLP are relatively nascent. In this paper, we review contemporary studies on recognizing and mitigating gender bias in NLP. We discuss gender bias based on four forms of representation bias and analyze methods recognizing gender bias. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of existing gender debiasing methods. Finally, we discuss future studies for recognizing and mitigating gender bias in NLP.},

Thanks to the availability of large corpora collections and the capability of deep architectures to shape internal language mechanisms in self-supervised learning processes (also known as “pre-training”), versatile and performing models are released continuously for every new network design. These networks, somehow, learn a probability distribution of words and relations across the training collection used, inheriting the potential flaws, inconsistencies and biases contained in such a collection. As pre-trained models have been found to be very useful approaches to transfer learning, dealing with bias has become a relevant issue in this new scenario. We introduce bias in a formal way and explore how it has been treated in several networks, in terms of detection and correction. In addition, available resources are identified and a strategy to deal with bias in deep NLP is proposed.},

Next, we demonstrate that the neural embeddings that are the critical first step in most NLP pipelines similarly contain undesirable biases towards mentions of disability. We end by highlighting topical biases in the discourse about disability which may contribute to the observed model biases; for instance, gun violence, homelessness, and drug addiction are over-represented in texts discussing mental illness.},

            Recently, there has been an increased interest in demographically grounded bias in natural language processing (NLP) applications. Much of the recent work has focused on describing bias and providing an overview of bias in a larger context. Here, we provide a simple, actionable summary of this recent work. We outline five sources where bias can occur in NLP systems: (1) the data, (2) the annotation process, (3) the input representations, (4) the models, and finally (5) the research design (or how we conceptualize our research). We explore each of the bias sources in detail in this article, including examples and links to related work, as well as potential counter‐measures.},

In our study, we prompt the models for advice involving a named individual across a variety of scenarios, such as during car purchase negotiations or election outcome predictions. We find that the advice systematically disadvantages names that are commonly associated with racial minorities and women. Names associated with Black women receive the least advantageous outcomes. The biases are consistent across 42 prompt templates and several models, indicating a systemic issue rather than isolated incidents. While providing numerical, decision-relevant anchors in the prompt can successfully counteract the biases, qualitative details have inconsistent effects and may even increase disparities. Our findings underscore the importance of conducting audits at the point of LLM deployment and implementation to mitigate their potential for harm against marginalized communities.},

BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

	abstract = {The development of quantum computing across several technologies and platforms has reached the point of having an advantage over classical computers for an artificial problem, a point known as ‘quantum advantage’. As a next step along the development of this technology, it is now important to discuss ‘practical quantum advantage’, the point at which quantum devices will solve problems of practical interest that are not tractable for traditional supercomputers. Many of the most promising short-term applications of quantum computers fall under the umbrella of quantum simulation: modelling the quantum properties of microscopic particles that are directly relevant to modern materials science, high-energy physics and quantum chemistry. This would impact several important real-world applications, such as developing materials for batteries, industrial catalysis or nitrogen fixing. Much as aerodynamics can be studied either through simulations on a digital computer or in a wind tunnel, quantum simulation can be performed not only on future fault-tolerant digital quantum computers but also already today through special-purpose analogue quantum simulators. Here we overview the state of the art and future perspectives for quantum simulation, arguing that a first practical quantum advantage already exists in the case of specialized applications of analogue devices, and that fully digital devices open a full range of applications but require further development of fault-tolerant hardware. Hybrid digital–analogue devices that exist today already promise substantial flexibility in near-term applications.},

	abstract = {Machine learning has been highly successful in data-intensive applications but is often hampered when the data set is small. Recently, Few-shot Learning (FSL) is proposed to tackle this problem. Using prior knowledge, FSL can rapidly generalize to new tasks containing only a few samples with supervised information. In this article, we conduct a thorough survey to fully understand FSL. Starting from a formal definition of FSL, we distinguish FSL from several relevant machine learning problems. We then point out that the core issue in FSL is that the empirical risk minimizer is unreliable. Based on how prior knowledge can be used to handle this core issue, we categorize FSL methods from three perspectives: (i) data, which uses prior knowledge to augment the supervised experience; (ii) model, which uses prior knowledge to reduce the size of the hypothesis space; and (iii) algorithm, which uses prior knowledge to alter the search for the best hypothesis in the given hypothesis space. With this taxonomy, we review and discuss the pros and cons of each category. Promising directions, in the aspects of the FSL problem setups, techniques, applications, and theories, are also proposed to provide insights for future research.

Furthermore, data is often not available due to not only the nature of the problem or privacy concerns but also the cost of data preparation. Data collection, preprocessing, and labeling are strenuous human tasks. Therefore, few-shot learning that could drastically reduce the turnaround time of building machine learning applications emerges as a low-cost solution. This survey paper comprises a representative list of recently proposed few-shot learning algorithms.

	abstract = {The representation of words as vectors, conventionally known as word embeddings, has drawn considerable attention in recent years as feature learning techniques for natural language processing. The majority of these methods operate solely on the semantic and the syntactic aspects of a text, remaining oblivious to sentimental information. However, as numerous words with opposite polarities may appear in similar contexts, such as “interesting” and “boring”, the exclusive use of context-oriented information lacks the required particulars for generating word embeddings as features in sentiment analysis. Along this thread, the present study proposes two novel unsupervised models to integrating word polarity information and word co-occurrences as more tailored features for sentiment analysis. Word polarity and co-occurrence come together in the form of a tensor and tensor factorization is employed for generating the word embeddings. The experimental results on IMDB and SemEval-task2 datasets demonstrate the relatively higher performance of the proposed method compared to baseline approaches on the tasks of document-level sentiment analysis by 4.},

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in both academia and industry, owing to their unprecedented performance in various applications. As LLMs continue to play a vital role in both research and daily use, their evaluation becomes increasingly critical, not only at the task level, but also at the society level for better understanding of their potential risks. Over the past years, significant efforts have been made to examine LLMs from various perspectives. This paper presents a comprehensive review of these evaluation methods for LLMs, focusing on three key dimensions: 
              what to evaluate 
              , 
              where to evaluate 
              , and 
              how to evaluate 
              . Firstly, we provide an overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general natural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics, education, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas. Secondly, we answer the ‘where’ and ‘how’ questions by diving into the evaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in assessing the performance of LLMs. Then, we summarize the success and failure cases of LLMs in different tasks. Finally, we shed light on several future challenges that lie ahead in LLMs evaluation. Our aim is to offer invaluable insights to researchers in the realm of LLMs evaluation, thereby aiding the development of more proficient LLMs. Our key point is that evaluation should be treated as an essential discipline to better assist the development of LLMs. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at:

This Progress Report focuses on the basic theoretical ideas behind quantum dense coding, discussing its development history from discrete and continuous variables to quantum networks, then to its variant protocols and applications in quantum secure communication. With this basic background in hand, then the main experimental achievements are reviewed, from photonic qubits and qudits to optical modes, nuclear magnetic resonance, and atomic systems. Besides the state of the art, finally potential future steps are discussed.},

              Classical autoencoders are neural networks that can learn efficient low-dimensional representations of data in higher-dimensional space. The task of an autoencoder is, given an input 
              x 
              , to map 
              x 
              to a lower dimensional point

              such that

              can likely be recovered from 
              y 
              . The structure of the underlying autoencoder network can be chosen to represent the data on a smaller dimension, effectively compressing the input. Inspired by this idea, we introduce the model of a quantum autoencoder to perform similar tasks on quantum data. The quantum autoencoder is trained to compress a particular data set of quantum states, where a classical compression algorithm cannot be employed. The parameters of the quantum autoencoder are trained using classical optimization algorithms. We show an example of a simple programmable circuit that can be trained as an efficient autoencoder. We apply our model in the context of quantum simulation to compress ground states of the Hubbard model and molecular Hamiltonians.},

The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

	abstract = {Variational quantum circuits have recently gained much interest due to their relevance in real-world applications, such as combinatorial optimizations, quantum simulations, and modeling a probability distribution. Despite their huge potential, the practical usefulness of those circuits beyond tens of qubits is largely questioned. One of the major problems is the so-called barren plateaus phenomenon. Quantum circuits with a random structure often have a flat cost-function landscape and thus cannot be trained efficiently. In this paper, we propose two novel parameter conditions in which the hardware-efficient ansatz (HEA) is free from barren plateaus for arbitrary circuit depths. In the first condition, the HEA approximates to a time-evolution operator generated by a local Hamiltonian. Utilizing a recent result by [Park and Killoran, Quantum 8, 1239 (2024)], we prove a constant lower bound of gradient magnitudes in any depth both for local and global observables. On the other hand, the HEA is within the many-body localized (MBL) phase in the second parameter condition. We argue that the HEA in this phase has a large gradient component for a local observable using a phenomenological model for the MBL system. By initializing the parameters of the HEA using these conditions, we show that our findings offer better overall performance in solving many-body Hamiltonians. Our results indicate that barren plateaus are not an issue when initial parameters are smartly chosen, and other factors, such as local minima or the expressivity of the circuit, are more crucial.},

              Variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithms (VHQCAs) are near-term algorithms that leverage classical optimization to minimize a cost function, which is efficiently evaluated on a quantum computer. Recently VHQCAs have been proposed for quantum compiling, where a target unitary 
              U 
              is compiled into a short-depth gate sequence 
              V 
              . In this work, we report on a surprising form of noise resilience for these algorithms. Namely, we find one often learns the correct gate sequence 
              V 
              (i.e. the correct variational parameters) despite various sources of incoherent noise acting during the cost-evaluation circuit. Our main results are rigorous theorems stating that the optimal variational parameters are unaffected by a broad class of noise models, such as measurement noise, gate noise, and Pauli channel noise. Furthermore, our numerical implementations on IBM’s noisy simulator demonstrate resilience when compiling the quantum Fourier transform, Toffoli gate, and W-state preparation. Hence, variational quantum compiling, due to its robustness, could be practically useful for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Finally, we speculate that this noise resilience may be a general phenomenon that applies to other VHQCAs such as the variational quantum eigensolver.},

We describe how this is increasingly seen to be a distinct phase in the development of quantum computers, heralding an era where we have quantum computers that are capable of doing certain quantum computations in a limited fashion, and subject to certain constraints and noise. We further discuss the prominent algorithms that are believed to hold the most potential for this era, and also describe the competing physical platforms on which to build a quantum computer that have seen the most success so far. We then talk about the applications that are most feasible in the near-term, and finish off with a short discussion on the state of the field. We hope that as non-experts read this article, it will give context to the recent developments in quantum computers that have garnered much popular press, and help the community understand how to place such developments in the timeline of quantum computing.},

	abstract = {We can learn from analyzing quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) that: 1) working with quantum data can be perceived as embedding physical system parameters through a hidden feature map; 2) their high performance for quantum phase recognition can be attributed to generation of a very suitable basis set during the ground state embedding, where quantum criticality of spin models leads to basis functions with rapidly changing features; 3) pooling layers of QCNNs are responsible for picking those basis functions that can contribute to forming a high-performing decision boundary, and the learning process corresponds to adapting the measurement such that few-qubit operators are mapped to full-register observables; 4) generalization of QCNN models strongly depends on the embedding type, and that rotation-based feature maps with the Fourier basis require careful feature engineering; 5) accuracy and generalization of QCNNs with readout based on a limited number of shots favor the ground state embeddings and associated physics-informed models. We demonstrate these points in simulation, where our results shed light on classification for physical processes, relevant for applications in sensing. Finally, we show that QCNNs with properly chosen ground state embeddings can be used for fluid dynamics problems, expressing shock wave solutions with good generalization and proven trainability.},

	abstract = {Quantum algorithms have the potential to outperform their classical counterparts in a variety of tasks. The realization of the advantage often requires the ability to load classical data efficiently into quantum states. However, the best known methods require \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\}{\textbackslash}left(\{2\}{\textasciicircum}\{n\}{\textbackslash}right)\$\$ gates to load an exact representation of a generic data structure into an \$\$n\$\$-qubit state. This scaling can easily predominate the complexity of a quantum algorithm and, thereby, impair potential quantum advantage. Our work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for efficient, approximate quantum state loading. More precisely, we use quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) to facilitate efficient learning and loading of generic probability distributions - implicitly given by data samples - into quantum states. Through the interplay of a quantum channel, such as a variational quantum circuit, and a classical neural network, the qGAN can learn a representation of the probability distribution underlying the data samples and load it into a quantum state. The loading requires \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\}{\textbackslash}left(poly{\textbackslash}left(n{\textbackslash}right){\textbackslash}right)\$\$ gates and can thus enable the use of potentially advantageous quantum algorithms, such as Quantum Amplitude Estimation. We implement the qGAN distribution learning and loading method with Qiskit and test it using a quantum simulation as well as actual quantum processors provided by the IBM Q Experience. Furthermore, we employ quantum simulation to demonstrate the use of the trained quantum channel in a quantum finance application.},

In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation.

	abstract = {With the overwhelming success in the field of quantum information in the last decades, the ‘quest’ for a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) model began in order to combine quantum computing with the striking properties of neural computing. This article presents a systematic approach to QNN research, which so far consists of a conglomeration of ideas and proposals. Concentrating on Hopfield-type networks and the task of associative memory, it outlines the challenge of combining the nonlinear, dissipative dynamics of neural computing and the linear, unitary dynamics of quantum computing. It establishes requirements for a meaningful QNN and reviews existing literature against these requirements. It is found that none of the proposals for a potential QNN model fully exploits both the advantages of quantum physics and computing in neural networks. An outlook on possible ways forward is given, emphasizing the idea of Open Quantum Neural Networks based on dissipative quantum computing.},

Here, we show how many of the features of neural networks for machine learning can naturally be mapped into the quantum optical domain by introducing the quantum optical neural network (QONN). Through numerical simulation and analysis we train the QONN to perform a range of quantum information processing tasks, including newly developed protocols for quantum optical state compression, reinforcement learning, and black-box quantum simulation. We consistently demonstrate our system can generalize from only a small set of training data onto states for which it has not been trained. Our results indicate QONNs are a powerful design tool for quantum optical systems and, leveraging advances in integrated quantum photonics, a promising architecture for next generation quantum processors.},

	abstract = {We introduce a general method for building neural networks on quantum computers. The quantum neural network is a variational quantum circuit built in the continuous-variable (CV) architecture, which encodes quantum information in continuous degrees of freedom such as the amplitudes of the electromagnetic field. This circuit contains a layered structure of continuously parameterized gates which is universal for CV quantum computation. Affine transformations and nonlinear activation functions, two key elements in neural networks, are enacted in the quantum network using Gaussian and non-Gaussian gates, respectively. The non-Gaussian gates provide both the nonlinearity and the universality of the model. Due to the structure of the CV model, the CV quantum neural network can encode highly nonlinear transformations while remaining completely unitary. We show how a classical network can be embedded into the quantum formalism and propose quantum versions of various specialized model such as convolutional, recurrent, and residual networks. Finally, we present numerous modeling experiments built with the Strawberry Fields software library. These experiments, including a classifier for fraud detection, a network which generates Tetris images, and a hybrid classical-quantum autoencoder, demonstrate the capability and adaptability of CV quantum neural networks.},

	abstract = {We introduce a quantum neural network, QNN, that can represent labeled data, classical or quantum, and be trained by supervised learning. The quantum circuit consists of a sequence of parameter dependent unitary transformations which acts on an input quantum state. For binary classification a single Pauli operator is measured on a designated readout qubit. The measured output is the quantum neural network's predictor of the binary label of the input state. First we look at classifying classical data sets which consist of n-bit strings with binary labels. The input quantum state is an n-bit computational basis state corresponding to a sample string. We show how to design a circuit made from two qubit unitaries that can correctly represent the label of any Boolean function of n bits. For certain label functions the circuit is exponentially long. We introduce parameter dependent unitaries that can be adapted by supervised learning of labeled data. We study an example of real world data consisting of downsampled images of handwritten digits each of which has been labeled as one of two distinct digits. We show through classical simulation that parameters can be found that allow the QNN to learn to correctly distinguish the two data sets. We then discuss presenting the data as quantum superpositions of computational basis states corresponding to different label values. Here we show through simulation that learning is possible. We consider using our QNN to learn the label of a general quantum state. By example we show that this can be done. Our work is exploratory and relies on the classical simulation of small quantum systems. The QNN proposed here was designed with near-term quantum processors in mind. Therefore it will be possible to run this QNN on a near term gate model quantum computer where its power can be explored beyond what can be explored with simulation.},

	abstract = {Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models train a parametrized quantum circuit to solve a given learning task. The success of these algorithms greatly hinges on appropriately choosing an ansatz for the quantum circuit. Perhaps one of the most famous ansatzes is the one-dimensional layered Hardware Efficient Ansatz (HEA), which seeks to minimize the effect of hardware noise by using native gates and connectives. The use of this HEA has generated a certain ambivalence arising from the fact that while it suffers from barren plateaus at long depths, it can also avoid them at shallow ones. In this work, we attempt to determine whether one should, or should not, use a HEA. We rigorously identify scenarios where shallow HEAs should likely be avoided (e.g., VQA or QML tasks with data satisfying a volume law of entanglement). More importantly, we identify a Goldilocks scenario where shallow HEAs could achieve a quantum speedup: QML tasks with data satisfying an area law of entanglement. We provide examples for such scenario (such as Gaussian diagonal ensemble random Hamiltonian discrimination), and we show that in these cases a shallow HEA is always trainable and that there exists an anti-concentration of loss function values. Our work highlights the crucial role that input states play in the trainability of a parametrized quantum circuit, a phenomenon that is verified in our numerics.},

Here, we report the first demonstration of resolved-sideband cooling of a mesoscopic mechanical oscillator, a key step towards ground-state cooling as quantum back-action is sufficiently suppressed in this scheme. A laser drives the first lower sideband of an optical microcavity resonance, the decay rate of which is twenty times smaller than the eigenfrequency of the associated mechanical oscillator. Cooling rates above 1.5 MHz are attained, three orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic dissipation rate of the mechanical device that is independently monitored at the level. Direct spectroscopy of the motional sidebands of the cooling laser confirms the expected suppression of motional increasing processes during cooling. Moreover, using two-mode pumping, this regime could enable motion measurement beyond the standard quantum limit and the concomitant generation of non-classical states of motion.},

              Dark Matter (DM) is an elusive form of matter which has been postulated to explain astronomical observations through its gravitational effects on stars and galaxies, gravitational lensing of light around these and through its imprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This indirect evidence implies that DM accounts for as much as 84.5\% of all matter in our Universe, yet it has so far evaded all attempts at direct detection, leaving such confirmation and the consequent discovery of its nature as one of the biggest challenges in modern physics. Here we present a novel form of low-mass DM χ that would have been missed by 
              all 
              experiments so far. While its large interaction strength might at first seem unlikely, neither constraints from particle physics nor cosmological/astronomical observations are sufficient to rule out this type of DM and it motivates our proposal for direct detection by optomechanics technology which should soon be within reach, namely, through the precise position measurement of a levitated mesoscopic particle which will be perturbed by elastic collisions with χ particles. We show that a recently proposed nanoparticle matter-wave interferometer, originally conceived for tests of the quantum superposition principle, is sensitive to these collisions, too.},

	abstract = {Fast detection and characterization of single nanoparticles such as viruses, airborne aerosols and colloidal particles are considered to be particularly important for medical applications, material science and atmospheric physics. In particular, non-intrusive optical characterization, which can be carried out in isolation from other particles, and without the deleterious effects of a substrate or solvent, is seen to be particularly important. Optical characterization via the scattering of light does not require complicated sample preparation and can in principle be carried out in-situ. We describe the characterization of single nanoparticle shape based on the measurement of their rotational and oscillatory motion when optically levitated within vacuum. Using colloidally grown yttrium lithium fluoride nanocrystals of different sizes, trapped in a single-beam optical tweezer, we demonstrate the utility of this method which is in good agreement with simulations of the dynamics. Size differences as small as a few nanometers could be resolved using this technique offering a new optical spectroscopic tool for non-contact characterization of single nanoparticles in the absence of a substrate.},

            Near-field, radially symmetric optical potentials supported by a levitated nanosphere can be used for sympathetic cooling and for creating a bound nanosphere-atom system analogous to a large molecule. We demonstrate that the long range, Coulomb-like potential produced by a single blue detuned field increases the collisional cross-section by eight orders of magnitude, allowing fast sympathetic cooling of a trapped nanosphere to microKelvin temperatures using cold atoms. By using two optical fields to create a combination of repulsive and attractive potentials, we demonstrate that a cold atom can be bound to a nanosphere creating a new levitated hybrid quantum system suitable for exploring quantum mechanics with massive particles.},

In this paper, we apply Quantum Machine Learning (QML) frameworks to improve binary classification models for noisy datasets which are prevalent in financial datasets. The metric we use for assessing the performance of our quantum classifiers is the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC/AUC). By combining such approaches as hybrid-neural networks, parametric circuits, and data re-uploading we create QML inspired architectures and utilise them for the classification of non-convex 2 and 3-dimensional figures. An extensive benchmarking of our new FULL HYBRID classifiers against existing quantum and classical classifier models, reveals that our novel models exhibit better learning characteristics to asymmetrical Gaussian noise in the dataset compared to known quantum classifiers and performs equally well for existing classical classifiers, with a slight improvement over classical results in the region of the high noise.},

In addition,-for the text classification and texture recognition, it can also be used in classification of images, videos, robot localization, etc. It is one of the most common methods for the categorization of text and objects. In text classification, the BoW method records the number of occurrences of each bag that is created for each instance type or word disregarding the order of the words or the grammar. And in visual scene classification it is based on clusters of local descriptors which are taken from the images disregarding the order of the clusters. The key idea is to generate a histogram for the words in the documents or the features in the images to represent the specified document or image. The BoW method is computationally and even conceptually is simpler than many other classification methods. For that reason, BoW based systems could record new and higher performance scores on common used benchmarks of text and image classification algorithms. This paper presents an overview of BoW, importance of BoW, how does it work, applications and challenges of using BoW. This study is useful in terms of introducing the BoW method to the new researchers and providing a good background with associated related works to the researchers that are working on the model.},

	abstract = {Parameterized quantum circuits play an essential role in the performance of many variational hybrid quantum-classical (HQC) algorithms. One challenge in implementing such algorithms is to choose an effective circuit that well represents the solution space while maintaining a low circuit depth and number of parameters. To characterize and identify expressible, yet compact, parameterized circuits, we propose several descriptors, including measures of expressibility and entangling capability, that can be statistically estimated from classical simulations of parameterized quantum circuits. We compute these descriptors for different circuit structures, varying the qubit connectivity and selection of gates. From our simulations, we identify circuit fragments that perform well with respect to the descriptors. In particular, we quantify the substantial improvement in performance of two-qubit gates in a ring or all-to-all connected arrangement compared to that of those on a line. Furthermore, we quantify the improvement in expressibility and entangling capability achieved by sequences of controlled X-rotation gates compared to sequences of controlled Z-rotation gates. In addition, we investigate how expressibility "saturates" with increased circuit depth, finding that the rate and saturated-value appear to be distinguishing features of a parameterized quantum circuit template. While the correlation between each descriptor and performance of an algorithm remains to be investigated, methods and results from this study can be useful for both algorithm development and design of experiments for general variational HQC algorithms.},

Even though the basic AlxGa1−xAs/GaAs heterostructure concepts are understood at this time, some practical device parameters in this system have been hampered by a lack of definite knowledge of many material parameters. Recently, Blakemore has presented numerical and graphical information about many of the physical and electronic properties of GaAs [J. S. Blakemore, J. Appl. Phys. 53, R123 (1982)]. The purpose of this review is (i) to obtain and clarify all the various material parameters of AlxGa1−xAs alloy from a systematic point of view, and (ii) to present key properties of the material parameters for a variety of research works and device applications. A complete set of material parameters are considered in this review for GaAs, AlAs, and AlxGa1−xAs alloys. The model used is based on an interpolation scheme and, therefore, necessitates known values of the parameters for the related binaries (GaAs and AlAs). The material parameters and properties considered in the present review can be classified into sixteen groups: (1) lattice constant and crystal density, (2) melting point, (3) thermal expansion coefficient, (4) lattice dynamic properties, (5) lattice thermal properties, (6) electronic-band structure, (7) external perturbation effects on the band-gap energy, (8) effective mass, (9) deformation potential, (10) static and high-frequency dielectric constants, (11) magnetic susceptibility, (12) piezoelectric constant, (13) Fröhlich coupling parameter, (14) electron transport properties, (15) optical properties, and (16) photoelastic properties.
            Of particular interest is the deviation of material parameters from linearity with respect to the AlAs mole fraction x. Some material parameters, such as lattice constant, crystal density, thermal expansion coefficient, dielectric constant, and elastic constant, obey Vegard’s rule well. Other parameters, e.g., electronic-band energy, lattice vibration (phonon) energy, Debye temperature, and impurity ionization energy, exhibit quadratic dependence upon the AlAs mole fraction. However, some kinds of the material parameters, e.g., lattice thermal conductivity, exhibit very strong nonlinearity with respect to x, which arises from the effects of alloy disorder. It is found that the present model provides generally acceptable parameters in good agreement with the existing experimental data. A detailed discussion is also given of the acceptability of such interpolated parameters from an aspect of solid-state physics. Key properties of the material parameters for use in research work and a variety of AlxGa1−xAs/GaAs device applications are also discussed in detail.},

	abstract = {High-speed, oxide-confined, polyimide-planarized 850 nm vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) with different aperture sizes were fabricated and characterized. Comprehensive small signal measurements and analysis were conducted. The VCSELs exhibit intrinsic, parasitic and thermal maximum bandwidth limitations of 42.3 GHz, 21.5 GHz and 17.6 GHz, respectively. Devices with a 10 µm oxide aperture exhibited a maximum modulation bandwidth of 15.3 GHz, limited by thermal effects, and a modulation current efficiency factor (MCEF) of 9.2 GHz mA−1/2. A VCSEL equivalent circuit model which incorporates the frequency dependence of the polyimide dielectric permittivity and loss is presented. A genetic algorithm (GA) was utilized to extract the parasitic circuit elements from measured microwave reflection coefficients (S11) over a frequency range of 50 MHz to 20 GHz for different device sizes at different bias currents. Good agreement between extracted and calculated parasitic circuit element values was obtained. Several modifications to the device's fabrication steps and structure are suggested to further improve the device's output power and modulation bandwidth.},

Al comienzo del nuevo siglo mexicano se imaginaba el futuro del país como una prometedora página en blanco. Los personajes de Nadie me verá llorar desean reinventarse a la par de su país y dejar su marca sobre esa página. La protagonista Matilda Burgos llega a ser el palimpsesto sobre el que varios de los personajes masculinos de la novela intentan superponer sus proyectos y caracterizaciones, ya sea con el fin de diagnosticarla, el de definirla, o el de enamorarla. A su vez, Matilda se inscribe en el palimpsesto que es la Ciudad de México a finales del siglo XIX y principios del XX. Este artículo examina los diversos intentos de superponer una u otra identidad conveniente sobre Matilda y los deseos de dar una u otra forma al México moderno, arguyendo que el desenlace de la novela sugiere que los dos intentos están destinados al fracaso por querer desentender lo que ya estaba escrito sobre la supuesta página en blanco de la modernidad.},

The paper first presents structural results based on atomic force and transmission electron microscopy studies of the quantum dot arrays which were obtained by MBE and MOCVD growth. From the detailed structural analysis we have observed that the formation of coherently strained dots of InAs, InAlAs, and InP dots on various cladding layer surfaces. MBE growth of InAs self-assembled dots has achieved the smallest size distribution, with dots as small as 12nm in diameter. For the MOCVD growth of InP dots we have found that the surface morphology and growth temperature of lower cladding layer growth has a profound influence on island size and density. Recent results on the optical and transport properties of the MBE grown self-assembling dot (SAD) arrays are also presented.},

	abstract = {High-performance III-V quantum-dot lasers monolithically grown on Si substrates have been demonstrated as a promising solution to realize Si-based laser sources with very low threshold current density, high output power, and long lifetime, even with relatively high density of defects due to the material dissimilarities between III-Vs and Si. On the other hand, although conventional III-V quantum-well lasers grown on Si have been demonstrated after great efforts worldwide for more than 40 years, their practicality is still a great challenge because of their very high threshold current density and very short lifetime. However, the physical mechanisms behind the superior performance of silicon-based III-V quantum-dot lasers remain unclear. In this paper, we directly compare the performance of a quantum-well and a quantum-dot laser monolithically grown on on-axis Si (001) substrates, both experimentally and theoretically, under the impact of the same density of threading dislocations. A quantum-dot laser grown on a Si substrate with a high operating temperature (105 °C) has been demonstrated with a low threshold current density of 173 A/cm2 and a high single facet output power {\textgreater}100 mW at room temperature, while there is no lasing operation for the quantum-well device at room temperature even at high injection levels. By using a rate equation travelling-wave model, the quantum-dot laser's superior performance compared with its quantum well-based counterpart on Si is theoretically explained in terms of the unique properties of quantum dots, i.e., efficient carrier capture and high thermal energy barriers preventing the carriers from migrating into defect states.},

Suppression of the parasitic recombination outside the QDs, which is the dominant source of the temperature dependence of the threshold current in the conventional design of a QD laser, is accomplished either by tunneling injection of carriers into the QDs or by band-gap engineering. Elimination of this recombination channel alone enhances the characteristic temperatures T0 above 1000 K. Remaining sources of temperature dependence (recombination from higher QD levels, inhomogeneous line broadening, and violation of charge neutrality in QDs) are studied. Tunneling-injection structures are shown to offer an additional advantage of suppressed effects of inhomogeneous broadening and neutrality violation.},

Alloying of GaAs with nitrogen can further enhance performance and extend device functionality via band-structure and lattice engineering. However, due to a large surface-to-volume ratio, III-V NWs suffer from severe non-radiative carrier recombination at/near NWs surfaces that significantly degrades optical quality. Here we show that increasing nitrogen composition in novel GaAs/GaNAs core/shell NWs can strongly suppress the detrimental surface recombination. This conclusion is based on our experimental finding that lifetimes of photo-generated free excitons and free carriers increase with increasing N composition, as revealed from our time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) studies. This is accompanied by a sizable enhancement in the PL intensity of the GaAs/GaNAs core/shell NWs at room temperature. The observed N-induced suppression of the surface recombination is concluded to be a result of an N-induced modification of the surface states that are responsible for the nonradiative recombination. Our results, therefore, demonstrate the great potential of incorporating GaNAs in III-V NWs to achieve efficient nano-scale light emitters.},

It is found that surface recombination plays a key role in determining the performance of nanostructured thin-film solar cells. Once the recombination effect is considered, the higher optical absorption does not mean the higher conversion efficiency as most existing publications claimed. Both the surface recombination velocity and geometric parameters of structure have great impact on the efficiency of thin-film solar cells. Our simulation results indicate that nanostructured light trapping will not only improve optical absorption but also boost the surface recombination simultaneously. Therefore, we must get the tradeoffs between optical absorption and surface recombination to obtain the maximum conversion efficiency.

          , 
            Liquid crystal (LC) droplets attract scientific attention for many advanced applications, including, but not limited to optical and sensing devices. To aid experimental advancements, theoretical calculations have been conducted to quantify molecular driving forces responsible for the collective behaviour of LC molecules within micrometer-size spherical droplets. To quantify the LC molecular anchoring within spherical physical constraints, molecular simulations at atomistic resolution would be useful. In an attempt to bridge the gap between computational capabilities and experimental interest, coarse-grained simulations are used here to study nematic LC nanodroplets dispersed in water. A LC phase diagram is generated as a function of droplet size and temperature. The effect of adding surfactants on LC anchoring was quantified, considering surfactants of different molecular features. When few surfactants are present, they self-assemble at the droplet boojums regardless of their molecular features. All surfactants tested shifted LC orientation from bipolar to uniaxial. When the surfactants have a hydrophobic tail of sufficient length, they cause deviations from the spherical symmetry of LC droplets. Increasing the concentration of these surfactants enhances such phenomenon. Simulations were also conducted to assess the ability of the surfactants to prevent the agglomeration between two LC droplets. The results showed that coalescence was inevitable at all conditions and suggested that large enough surfactant concentrations can delay the phenomenon. The results presented could be helpful for designing novel surface-active compounds to develop optical and/or sensing devices at conditions in which mutual solubility between water and LCs is low.},

In particular, the visible and near-infrared wavelength range is of interest for a range of sensing and communication applications. The integration of energy-efficient III-V lasers, such as vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), is important for expanding the application portfolio of such PICs. However, most of the demonstrated integration approaches are not easily scalable towards low-cost and large-volume production. In this work, we demonstrate the micro-transfer-printing of bottom-emitting VCSELs on silicon nitride PICs as a path to achieve this. The demonstrated 850 nm lasers show waveguide-coupled powers exceeding 100 µW, with sub-mA lasing thresholds and mW-level power consumption. A single-mode laser with a side-mode suppression ratio over 45 dB and a tuning range of 5 nm is demonstrated. Combining micro-transfer-printing integration with the extended-cavity VCSEL design developed in this work provides the silicon nitride PIC industry with a great tool to integrate energy-efficient VCSELs onto silicon nitride PICs.},

Here we explicitly construct an unprecedentedly broader family of supervised learning tasks with classical data to offer the provable advantage of QML based on general quantum computational advantages, progressing beyond Shor's algorithms. Our learning task is feasibly achievable by executing a general class of functions that can be computed efficiently in polynomial time for a large fraction of inputs by arbitrary quantum algorithms but not by any classical algorithm. We prove the hardness of achieving this learning task for any possible polynomial-time classical learning method. We also clarify protocols for preparing the classical data to demonstrate this learning task in experiments.

            Generative modeling has seen a rising interest in both classical and quantum machine learning, and it represents a promising candidate to obtain a practical quantum advantage in the near term. In this study, we build over an existing framework for evaluating the generalization performance of generative models, and we establish the first quantitative comparative race towards practical quantum advantage (PQA) between classical and quantum generative models, namely Quantum Circuit Born Machines (QCBMs), Transformers (TFs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs). After defining four types of PQAs scenarios, we focus on what we refer to as potential PQA, aiming to compare quantum models with the best-known classical algorithms for the task at hand. We let the models race on a well-defined and application-relevant competition setting, where we illustrate and demonstrate our framework on 20 variables (qubits) generative modeling task. Our results suggest that QCBMs are more efficient in the data-limited regime than the other state-of-the-art classical generative models. Such a feature is highly desirable in a wide range of real-world applications where the available data is scarce.},

            The main promise of quantum computing is to efficiently solve certain problems that are prohibitively expensive for a classical computer. Most problems with a proven quantum advantage involve the repeated use of a black box, or oracle, whose structure encodes the solution. One measure of the algorithmic performance is the query complexity, i.e., the scaling of the number of oracle calls needed to find the solution with a given probability. Few-qubit demonstrations of quantum algorithms, such as Deutsch–Jozsa and Grover, have been implemented across diverse physical systems such as nuclear magnetic resonance, trapped ions, optical systems, and superconducting circuits. However, at the small scale, these problems can already be solved classically with a few oracle queries, limiting the obtained advantage. Here we solve an oracle-based problem, known as learning parity with noise, on a five-qubit superconducting processor. Executing classical and quantum algorithms using the same oracle, we observe a large gap in query count in favor of quantum processing. We find that this gap grows by orders of magnitude as a function of the error rates and the problem size. This result demonstrates that, while complex fault-tolerant architectures will be required for universal quantum computing, a significant quantum advantage already emerges in existing noisy systems.},

            The search for an application of near-term quantum devices is widespread. Quantum machine learning is touted as a potential utilisation of such devices, particularly those out of reach of the simulation capabilities of classical computers. In this work, we study such an application in generative modelling, focussing on a class of quantum circuits known as Born machines. Specifically, we define a subset of this class based on Ising Hamiltonians and show that the circuits encountered during gradient-based training cannot be efficiently sampled from classically up to multiplicative error in the worst case. Our gradient-based training methods use cost functions known as the Sinkhorn divergence and the Stein discrepancy, which have not previously been used in the gradient-based training of quantum circuits, and we also introduce quantum kernels to generative modelling. We show that these methods outperform the previous standard method, which used maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as a cost function, and achieve this with minimal overhead. Finally, we discuss the ability of the model to learn hard distributions and provide formal definitions for ‘quantum learning supremacy’. We also exemplify the work of this paper by using generative modelling to perform quantum circuit compilation.},

            One of the main challenges of quantum many‐body physics is the exponential growth in the dimensionality of the Hilbert space with system size. This growth makes solving the Schrödinger equation of the system extremely difficult. Nonetheless, many physical systems have a simplified internal structure that typically makes the parameters needed to characterize their ground states exponentially smaller. Many numerical methods then become available to capture the physics of the system. Among modern numerical techniques, neural networks, which show great power in approximating functions and extracting features of big data, are now attracting much interest. In this work, the progress in using artificial neural networks to build quantum many‐body states is reviewed. The Boltzmann machine representation is taken as a prototypical example to illustrate various aspects of the neural network states. The classical neural networks are also briefly reviewed, and it is illustrated how to use neural networks to represent quantum states and density operators. Some physical properties of the neural network states are discussed. For applications, the progress in many‐body calculations based on neural network states, the neural network state approach to tomography, and the classical simulation of quantum computing based on Boltzmann machine states are briefly reviewed.},

Furthermore we prove that the algorithm can be classically efficiently simulated to within a prescribed tolerance {\textbackslash}eta even if a suitably small amount of global entanglement (depending on {\textbackslash}eta) is present. We explicitly identify the occurrence of increasing multi-partite entanglement in Shor's algorithm. Our results do not apply to quantum algorithms operating on mixed states in general and we discuss the suggestion that an exponential computational speed-up might be possible with mixed states in the total absence of entanglement. Finally, despite the essential role of entanglement for pure state algorithms, we argue that it is nevertheless misleading to view entanglement as a key resource for quantum computational power.},

Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: ‘every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means’. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the 'universal quantum computer’ are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include ‘quantum parallelism’, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett’s. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the ‘complexity’ or ‘knowledge’ in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.},

              Modern quantum machine learning (QML) methods involve variationally optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit on a training data set, and subsequently making predictions on a testing data set (i.e., generalizing). In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of generalization performance in QML after training on a limited number
              N
              of training data points. We show that the generalization error of a quantum machine learning model with
              T
              trainable gates scales at worst as
              
                
                  \$\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{T/N\}\$\$
                  
                    
                      
                        T
                        /
                        N
                      
                    
                  
                
              
              . When only
              K
               ≪ 
              T
              gates have undergone substantial change in the optimization process, we prove that the generalization error improves to
              
                
                  \$\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{K/N\}\$\$
                  
                    
                      
                        K
                        /
                        N
                      
                    
                  
                
              
              . Our results imply that the compiling of unitaries into a polynomial number of native gates, a crucial application for the quantum computing industry that typically uses exponential-size training data, can be sped up significantly. We also show that classification of quantum states across a phase transition with a quantum convolutional neural network requires only a very small training data set. Other potential applications include learning quantum error correcting codes or quantum dynamical simulation. Our work injects new hope into the field of QML, as good generalization is guaranteed from few training data.},

	abstract = {Machine learning has been highly successful in data-intensive applications but is often hampered when the data set is small. Recently, Few-shot Learning (FSL) is proposed to tackle this problem. Using prior knowledge, FSL can rapidly generalize to new tasks containing only a few samples with supervised information. In this article, we conduct a thorough survey to fully understand FSL. Starting from a formal definition of FSL, we distinguish FSL from several relevant machine learning problems. We then point out that the core issue in FSL is that the empirical risk minimizer is unreliable. Based on how prior knowledge can be used to handle this core issue, we categorize FSL methods from three perspectives: (i) data, which uses prior knowledge to augment the supervised experience; (ii) model, which uses prior knowledge to reduce the size of the hypothesis space; and (iii) algorithm, which uses prior knowledge to alter the search for the best hypothesis in the given hypothesis space. With this taxonomy, we review and discuss the pros and cons of each category. Promising directions, in the aspects of the FSL problem setups, techniques, applications, and theories, are also proposed to provide insights for future research.

	abstract = {Quantum computing has a potential to accelerate the data processing efficiency, especially in machine learning, by exploiting special features such as the quantum interference. The major challenge in this application is that, in general, the task of loading a classical data vector into a quantum state requires an exponential number of quantum gates. The approximate amplitude encoding (AAE) method, which uses a variational means to approximately load a given real-valued data vector into the amplitude of a quantum state, was recently proposed as a general approach to this problem mainly for near-term devices. However, AAE cannot load a complex-valued data vector, which narrows its application range. In this work, we extend AAE so that it can handle a complex-valued data vector. The key idea is to employ the fidelity distance as a cost function for optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit, where the classical shadow technique is used to efficiently estimate the fidelity and its gradient. We apply this algorithm to realize the complex-valued-kernel binary classifier called the compact Hadamard classifier, and then give a numerical experiment showing that it enables classification of Iris dataset and credit card fraud detection.},

	abstract = {Efficient methods for loading given classical data into quantum circuits are essential for various quantum algorithms. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called Approximate Amplitude Encoding that can effectively load all the components of a given real-valued data vector into the amplitude of quantum state, while the previous proposal can only load the absolute values of those components. The key of our algorithm is to variationally train a shallow parameterized quantum circuit, using the results of two types of measurement; the standard computational-basis measurement plus the measurement in the Hadamard-transformed basis, introduced in order to handle the sign of the data components. The variational algorithm changes the circuit parameters so as to minimize the sum of two costs corresponding to those two measurement basis, both of which are given by the efficiently-computable maximum mean discrepancy. We also consider the problem of constructing the singular value decomposition entropy via the stock market dataset to give a financial market indicator; a quantum algorithm (the variational singular value decomposition algorithm) is known to produce a solution faster than classical, which yet requires the sign-dependent amplitude encoding. We demonstrate, with an in-depth numerical analysis, that our algorithm realizes loading of time-series of real stock prices on quantum state with small approximation error, and thereby it enables constructing an indicator of the financial market based on the stock prices.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks have proved very successful on archetypal tasks for which large training sets are available, but when the training data are scarce, their performance suffers from overﬁtting. Many existing methods of reducing overﬁtting are data-independent. Data-dependent regularizations are mostly motivated by the observation that data of interest lie close to a manifold, which is typically hard to parametrize explicitly. These methods usually only focus on the geometry of the input data, and do not necessarily encourage the networks to produce geometrically meaningful features. To resolve this, we propose the Low-DimensionalManifold-regularized neural Network (LDMNet), which incorporates a feature regularization method that focuses on the geometry of both the input data and the output features. In LDMNet, we regularize the network by encouraging the combination of the input data and the output features to sample a collection of low dimensional manifolds, which are searched efﬁciently without explicit parametrization. To achieve this, we directly use the manifold dimension as a regularization term in a variational functional. The resulting Euler-Lagrange equation is a Laplace-Beltrami equation over a point cloud, which is solved by the point integral method without increasing the computational complexity. In the experiments, we show that LDMNet signiﬁcantly outperforms widely-used regularizers. Moreover, LDMNet can extract common features of an object imaged via different modalities, which is very useful in real-world applications such as cross-spectral face recognition.},

	abstract = {Quantum classifiers are trainable quantum circuits used as machine learning models. The first part of the circuit implements a quantum feature map that encodes classical inputs into quantum states, embedding the data in a high-dimensional Hilbert space; the second part of the circuit executes a quantum measurement interpreted as the output of the model. Usually, the measurement is trained to distinguish quantum-embedded data. We propose to instead train the first part of the circuit -- the embedding -- with the objective of maximally separating data classes in Hilbert space, a strategy we call quantum metric learning. As a result, the measurement minimizing a linear classification loss is already known and depends on the metric used: for embeddings separating data using the l1 or trace distance, this is the Helstrom measurement, while for the l2 or Hilbert-Schmidt distance, it is a simple overlap measurement. This approach provides a powerful analytic framework for quantum machine learning and eliminates a major component in current models, freeing up more precious resources to best leverage the capabilities of near-term quantum information processors.},

A suitable design approach are variational circuits where the parameters of gates are learnt, an approach that is particularly fruitful for applications in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a low-depth variational quantum algorithm for supervised learning. The input feature vectors are encoded into the amplitudes of a quantum system, and a quantum circuit of parametrised single and two-qubit gates together with a single-qubit measurement is used to classify the inputs. This circuit architecture ensures that the number of learnable parameters is poly-logarithmic in the input dimension. We propose a quantum-classical training scheme where the analytical gradients of the model can be estimated by running several slightly adapted versions of the variational circuit. We show with simulations that the circuit-centric quantum classifier performs well on standard classical benchmark datasets while requiring dramatically fewer parameters than other methods. We also evaluate sensitivity of the classification to state preparation and parameter noise, introduce a quantum version of dropout regularisation and provide a graphical representation of quantum gates as highly symmetric linear layers of a neural network.},

However, machine learning tasks where data is provided can be considerably different than commonly studied computational tasks. In this work, we show that some problems that are classically hard to compute can be easily predicted by classical machines learning from data. Using rigorous prediction error bounds as a foundation, we develop a methodology for assessing potential quantum advantage in learning tasks. The bounds are tight asymptotically and empirically predictive for a wide range of learning models. These constructions explain numerical results showing that with the help of data, classical machine learning models can be competitive with quantum models even if they are tailored to quantum problems. We then propose a projected quantum model that provides a simple and rigorous quantum speed-up for a learning problem in the fault-tolerant regime. For near-term implementations, we demonstrate a significant prediction advantage over some classical models on engineered data sets designed to demonstrate a maximal quantum advantage in one of the largest numerical tests for gate-based quantum machine learning to date, up to 30 qubits.},

However, the training of PQCs is notoriously challenging owing to the phenomenon of plateaus and/or the existence of (exponentially) many spurious local minima. In this work, we propose an efficient parameter initialization strategy with theoretical guarantees. We prove that if the initial domain of each parameter is reduced inversely proportional to the square root of circuit depth, then the magnitude of the cost gradient decays at most polynomially as a function of the depth. Our theoretical results are verified by numerical simulations of variational quantum eigensolver tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that the reduced-domain initialization strategy can protect specific quantum neural networks from exponentially many spurious local minima. Our results highlight the significance of an appropriate parameter initialization strategy and can be used to enhance the trainability of PQCs in variational quantum algorithms.},

Using this result we show that if the output distributions of uniform IQP circuit families could be classically efficiently sampled, even up to 41\% multiplicative error in the probabilities, then the infinite tower of classical complexity classes known as the polynomial hierarchy, would collapse to its third level. We mention some further results on the classical simulation properties of IQP circuit families, in particular showing that if the output distribution results from measurements on only O(log n) lines then it may in fact be classically efficiently sampled.},

Most such codes do not permit a straightforward implementation of non-Clifford logical operations, which are necessary to define a universal gate set.

In this work, we implement a small quantum algorithm, one-qubit addition, fault-tolerantly on the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum computer, using the [[8,3,2]] colour code. By removing unnecessary error-correction circuits and using low-overhead techniques for fault-tolerant preparation and measurement, we reduce the number of error-prone two-qubit gates and measurements to 36.

We use the ZH-calculus, a universal and complete graphical language for linear maps which naturally encodes counting problems in terms of diagrams, to give graphical reductions from \#SAT to several related counting problems. Some of these graphical reductions, like to \#2SAT, are substantially simpler than known reductions via the matrix permanent. Additionally, our approach allows us to consider the case of counting solutions modulo an integer on equal footing. Finally, since the ZH-calculus was originally introduced to reason about quantum computing, we show that the problem of evaluating ZH-diagrams in the fragment corresponding to the Clifford+T gateset, is in FP{\textasciicircum}\#P. Our results show that graphical calculi represent an intuitive and useful framework for reasoning about counting problems.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06409},
	abstract = {Natural language processing (NLP) is the field that attempts to make human language accessible to computers, and it relies on applying a mathematical model to express the meaning of symbolic language. One such model, DisCoCat, defines how to express both the meaning of individual words as well as their compositional nature. This model can be naturally implemented on quantum computers, leading to the field quantum NLP (QNLP). Recent experimental work used quantum machine learning techniques to map from text to class label using the expectation value of the quantum encoded sentence. Theoretical work has been done on computing the similarity of sentences but relies on an unrealized quantum memory store. The main goal of this thesis is to leverage the DisCoCat model to design a quantum-based kernel function that can be used by a support vector machine (SVM) for NLP tasks. Two similarity measures were studied: (i) the transition amplitude approach and (ii) the SWAP test. A simple NLP meaning classification task from previous work was used to train the word embeddings and evaluate the performance of both models. The Python module lambeq and its related software stack was used for implementation. The explicit model from previous work was used to train word embeddings and achieved a testing accuracy of \$93.09 {\textbackslash}pm 0.01\$\%. It was shown that both the SVM variants achieved a higher testing accuracy of \$95.72 {\textbackslash}pm 0.01\$\% for approach (i) and \$97.14 {\textbackslash}pm 0.01\$\% for (ii). The SWAP test was then simulated under a noise model defined by the real quantum device, ibmq\_guadalupe. The explicit model achieved an accuracy of \$91.94 {\textbackslash}pm 0.01\$\% while the SWAP test SVM achieved 96.7\% on the testing dataset, suggesting that the kernelized classifiers are resilient to noise. These are encouraging results and motivate further investigations of our proposed kernelized QNLP paradigm.},

We also provide a detailed discussion of the category which has sets as objects, relations as morphisms, and the cartesian product as its monoidal structure (Rel), and thirdly, categories with manifolds as objects and cobordisms between these as morphisms (2Cob). While sets, Hilbert spaces and manifolds do not share any non-trivial common structure, these three categories are in fact structurally very similar. Shared features are diagrammatic calculus, compact closed structure and particular kinds of internal comonoids which play an important role in each of them. The categories FdHilb and Rel moreover admit a categorical matrix calculus. Together these features guide us towards topological quantum field theories. We also discuss posetal categories, how group representations are in fact categorical constructs, and what strictification and coherence of monoidal categories is all about. In our attempt to complement the existing literature we omitted some very basic topics. For these we refer the reader to other available sources.},

            Monoidal category theory serves as a powerful framework for describing logical aspects of quantum theory, giving an abstract language for parallel and sequential composition and a conceptual way to understand many high-level quantum phenomena. Here, we lay the foundations for this categorical quantum mechanics, with an emphasis on the graphical calculus that makes computation intuitive. We describe superposition and entanglement using biproducts and dual objects, and show how quantum teleportation can be studied abstractly using these structures. We investigate monoids, Frobenius structures and Hopf algebras, showing how they can be used to model classical information and complementary observables. We describe the CP construction, a categorical tool to describe probabilistic quantum systems. The last chapter introduces higher categories, surface diagrams and 2-Hilbert spaces, and shows how the language of duality in monoidal 2-categories can be used to reason about quantum protocols, including quantum teleportation and dense coding. Previous knowledge of linear algebra, quantum information or category theory would give an ideal background for studying this text, but it is not assumed, with essential background material given in a self-contained introductory chapter. Throughout the text, we point out links with many other areas, such as representation theory, topology, quantum algebra, knot theory and probability theory, and present nonstandard models including sets and relations. All results are stated rigorously and full proofs are given as far as possible, making this book an invaluable reference for modern techniques in quantum logic, with much of the material not available in any other textbook.},

	abstract = {We propose a mathematical framework for a unification of the distributional theory of meaning in terms of vector space models, and a compositional theory for grammatical types, for which we rely on the algebra of Pregroups, introduced by Lambek. This mathematical framework enables us to compute the meaning of a well-typed sentence from the meanings of its constituents. Concretely, the type reductions of Pregroups are `lifted' to morphisms in a category, a procedure that transforms meanings of constituents into a meaning of the (well-typed) whole. Importantly, meanings of whole sentences live in a single space, independent of the grammatical structure of the sentence. Hence the inner-product can be used to compare meanings of arbitrary sentences, as it is for comparing the meanings of words in the distributional model. The mathematical structure we employ admits a purely diagrammatic calculus which exposes how the information flows between the words in a sentence in order to make up the meaning of the whole sentence. A variation of our `categorical model' which involves constraining the scalars of the vector spaces to the semiring of Booleans results in a Montague-style Boolean-valued semantics.},

This is commonly addressed using a form of greedy decoding such as beam search, where a limited number of highest-likelihood paths (the beam width) of the decoder are kept, and at the end the maximum-likelihood path is chosen. In this work, we construct a quantum algorithm to find the globally optimal parse (i.e. for infinite beam width) with high constant success probability. When the input to the decoder is distributed as a power-law with exponent \$k{\textgreater}0\$, our algorithm has runtime \$R{\textasciicircum}\{n f(R,k)\}\$, where \$R\$ is the alphabet size, \$n\$ the input length; here \$f{\textless}1/2\$, and \$f{\textbackslash}rightarrow 0\$ exponentially fast with increasing \$k\$, hence making our algorithm always more than quadratically faster than its classical counterpart. We further modify our procedure to recover a finite beam width variant, which enables an even stronger empirical speedup while still retaining higher accuracy than possible classically. Finally, we apply this quantum beam search decoder to Mozilla's implementation of Baidu's DeepSpeech neural net, which we show to exhibit such a power law word rank frequency.},

We use these representations to implement and successfully train NLP models that solve simple sentence classification tasks on quantum hardware. We conduct quantum simulations that compare the syntax-sensitive model of Coecke et al. with two baselines that use less or no syntax; specifically, we implement the quantum analogues of a "bag-of-words" model, where syntax is not taken into account at all, and of a word-sequence model, where only word order is respected. We demonstrate that all models converge smoothly both in simulations and when run on quantum hardware, and that the results are the expected ones based on the nature of the tasks and the datasets used.

With the commercialization of liquid-crystal devices, digital holography as an enabling tool has become accessible to all, and with it all-digital tools for the decomposition of light have finally come of age. We review recent advances in unravelling the properties of light, from the modal structure of laser beams to decoding the information stored in orbital angular momentum (OAM)-carrying fields. We show application of these tools to fiber lasers, solid-state lasers, and structured light created in the laboratory by holographic laser beam shaping. We show by experimental implementation how digital holograms may be used to infer the intensity, phase, wavefront, Poynting vector, polarization, and OAM density of some unknown optical field. In particular, we outline how virtually all the previous ISO-standard beam diagnostic techniques may be readily replaced with all-digital equivalents, thus paving the way for unravelling of light in real time. Such tools are highly relevant to the in situ analysis of laser systems, to mode division multiplexing as an emerging tool in optical communication, and for quantum information processing with entangled photons.},

	abstract = {We present an experimental realization of the first iteration in Grover's quantum algorithm using classical light and linear optical elements. The algorithm serves to find an entry marked by an oracle in an unstructured database. In our scheme, the quantum states encoding the database are represented by helical modes generated by means of a Spatial Light Modulator, while the marking corresponds to a π phase shift of the hidden mode. The optical implementation of Grover's algorithm then selectively amplifies the intensity of the marked mode such that it can be revealed by a modal decomposition. The core of the algorithm – a geometrical reflection of the point representing all database entries – is implemented in a single step independent of the size of the database. Moreover, we demonstrate experimentally that one iteration of the algorithm is enough to identify the marked entry, as a consequence of using classical states of light.},
